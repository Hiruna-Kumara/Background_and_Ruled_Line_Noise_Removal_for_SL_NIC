# High Performance Background and Ruled line Noise Removing.

This research is based on introducing high performing background and ruled line noise removing technique for Sri Lanakan NIC recognition system like OCR systems. Background noise removing is done by introducing two integrated model of fuzzy filtering and machine learning noise removing methods. Since there is two major methods of noise removing technique we developed first model as integrated model of fuzzy filtering and conditional generative adversarial network. Second model  is composed of fuzzy filtering and denoising autoencoder.

The architecture of first model can be show as below.
